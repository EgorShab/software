# HalfDozen Survey Platform

### Overview
This Angular Survey Platform is a full-stack web application designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and analyzing surveys. This folder houses both the client-side (front-end) and server-side (back-end) code, illustrating a comprehensive approach to web application development. The platform focuses on user interaction, data handling efficiency, and responsive design.

### Project Structure
**Front-End:** Developed with Angular, this layer is responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user interactions, and communicating with the server-side via API calls.

**Back-End:** Built using Node.js and Express.js, it handles server logic, API endpoints, authentication, and database interactions.

### Key Features
Survey Management: Intuitive tools for creating, editing, and managing surveys.
User Authentication: Secure login and user management system.
Responsive Design: Ensures the application is accessible and functional on various devices and screen sizes.
