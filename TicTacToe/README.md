# Tic Tac Toe Game
### Introduction
This repository hosts a C#.NET project featuring a classic Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). It is designed to offer a fun and interactive gaming experience with two distinct modes: a two-player mode for playing with a friend and a one-player mode where you can challenge the computer. In the one-player mode, the computer automatically makes moves, adding an element of unpredictability and challenge to the game.

- **One-Player Mode:** Test your skills against the computer in a single-player experience.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** A user-friendly interface built with WPF, providing a clear and vibrant visual experience.
- **Dynamic Game Status Updates:** Real-time updates for the current player's turn and ongoing score.
- **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of wins for both X and O players across sessions.
- **Customizable Settings:** Easily switch between two-player and one-player modes with a single click.
