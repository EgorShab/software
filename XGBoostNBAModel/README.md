# NBA Game Outcome Predictions

## Project Overview
This project leverages advanced machine learning techniques, including ensemble learning, to predict the outcomes of NBA games. Utilizing a rich dataset that comprises historical game data, player statistics, and team matchups, it synthesizes insights from various predictive models to offer accurate game outcome predictions.

### Key Features

- **Historical Analysis**: Dive into past NBA games to understand trends and patterns, leveraging historical data to inform future game outcomes.
- **Player Performance Metrics**: Detailed analysis of player statistics to gauge individual and collective team strengths, converting individual performances into a unified team-level metric for more accurate predictions.
- **Real-Time Data Scraping**: Automated retrieval of the latest game and player information to ensure predictions are based on the most current data available.
- **Ensemble Learning Models**: A sophisticated fusion of multiple predictive models, including XGBoost and other machine learning techniques, to enhance prediction accuracy by leveraging the strengths of each model.
- **Team Composition Analysis**: Evaluation of team compositions by analyzing player matchups, historical performance in similar compositions, and how changes in team rosters might impact game outcomes.
- **Visualization Tools**: Comprehensive graphical representation of model performance, feature influences, and prediction confidence levels to provide clear insights into the predictive process and outcomes.
- **Player to Team Conversion**: A specialized process that aggregates individual player statistics into team-level insights, allowing for a nuanced understanding of team capabilities and potential performance in upcoming games.
- **Predictive Analytics Dashboard**: An interactive dashboard that displays predictions, confidence scores, and historical data comparisons to facilitate easy interpretation of the predictions for analysts and enthusiasts alike.


## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python 3.8 or newer.
- Pip should be available for installing Python packages.

### Required Dependencies
Execute the following command to install all necessary Python modules for the project:

```sh
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 pandas numpy xgboost
```

## Detailed Usage Guide

### Setting Up the Project

#### Initial Configuration:

- Extract the project files into a designated directory.
- Install the required Python modules as listed above.

#### Data Analysis and Preparation:

1. Navigate to the `Games_History` and `Player_stats_ready` directories.
2. Use Jupyter Notebook/Lab to open and execute all cells within `Games_History.ipynb` and `Player_stats.ipynb`.

### File Organization

Before executing the prediction scripts, it's crucial to organize the project files correctly:

#### Data Files:

- Move `updated_nba_data.csv` from `Games_History` to the directory containing the Python prediction scripts.
- Similarly, transfer `ready_team_stats_matchup.csv` from `Player_stats_ready`.

#### Machine Learning Models:

- Ensure the `xgboost_history_trained_model.pkl`, `Team_lvl_matchup_xgboost_model.pkl`, and `history_xgboost_encoder.pkl` are located in the same directory as `5_XGBoost_NBA_future_games_pred.py`.

### Executing the Prediction Pipeline

Run the Python scripts sequentially to process the data and generate predictions:

1. Start with `1_Get_future_Data.py` and continue through to `5_XGBoost_NBA_future_games_pred.py`, following any prompts or instructions provided by the scripts.

## Advanced Features

### Ensemble Learning Approach

This project distinguishes itself with an ensemble learning method, strategically combining predictions from historical data analysis and team matchup models. This approach not only improves prediction accuracy but also offers insights into the relative importance of various features affecting game outcomes.

### Model Insights

- **Model Evaluation**: Detailed confusion matrices and accuracy metrics are provided for each model, allowing for a comprehensive evaluation of performance.
- **Feature Importance Visualization**: Gain insights into which factors most significantly impact game outcomes, informing future data collection and model refinement strategies.
